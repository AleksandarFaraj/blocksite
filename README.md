# blocksite
## Chrome extension that closes tab with certain url.
### How to use
Just set hostname(s) in extension's preferences and it will close any active tab, containing that hostname.
Use at least 4 characters for one hostname to prevent closing tabs with random sites.

Examples:  
fb.com  
youtube

### Why should I use it?
It can be useful for you, if you spend too much time at social network(fb, youtube, etc).  
There are other extensions that do the same thing, but they don't work so "silent".  
They show you a popup page and inform how much times you've tried to enter into "blocked" site.  
This extension doesn't do such things, it just silent close a tab and save your time.  

### To Do
*Dealing with many text-inputs is confusing. I want to replace all text-inputs in options page  
with one text-input. It will simplify the code. When it will be done, you can use construction  
like this: (pattern1)|(pattern2)|(pattern3)|(patternN) and write in a single text-input as many  
hostnames patterns, as you want.
